A program, consisting of Shell, Awk and Sed scripts, and calls to other Unix tools, as appropriate, that reads in either one or two text files containing text to be analysed. The top level Shell program should be called style_cmp. If one file is specified, a profile should be created and printed out to standard output. (More will be said about profiles below.) If two files are specified, a profile should be created for each, but rather than printing the profiles, your program should compare the profiles using a metric, which will be described below, and a score should be reported on standard output. The score reflects the distance between the two works in terms of their style; low scores, down to 0, imply that the same author is likely responsible for both works, while large scores imply different authors.
